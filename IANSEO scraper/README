The IANSEO scraper works by downloading the IANSEO webpage (the .php file) for a given round of a given tournament. 

For BUCS, each category in each tournament (e.g. Men Experienced Recurve, Women Experienced Longbow, etc.) is stored in it's own .php file.  The scraper will specifically download the qualifier rounds (i.e. the Portsmouth, WA1440, WA900, WA70).

It then finds the line that defines the table of results, where the archers' ranks, names, scores at each distance, etc. are stored.

From there it uses the html brackets <></> to extract the data, and puts it into excel sheets.

The URL list excel is used to iterate all possible names for the .php file, because they are formatted very inconsistently - e.g. Novice Men Compound might be abbreviated NMC, or MNC, or CMN, etc. 
Use this excel file to generate the list of possible urls for all rounds of a given tournament. Then the Python code reads the list, and tries to download all the .php files listed.
