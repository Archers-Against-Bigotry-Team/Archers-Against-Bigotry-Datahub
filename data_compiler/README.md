Create a folder in which this code will be saved.
Within that folder, create 2 new folders names "data" and "compiled_data".
Save the scraped BUCS data into the "data" folder.
Edit the R script to set the wroking directory to the "compiled_data" folder.
You can now run the R script. This will take 2-3 minutes to run and will create 9 .csv files in the "compiled_data" folder. Once the script has run, it will delete all objects in the R environment.
