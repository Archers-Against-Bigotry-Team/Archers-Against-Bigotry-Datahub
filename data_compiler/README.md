Running the BUCS compiler:  
Create a folder in which this code will be saved.  
Within that folder, create 2 new folders named "data" and "compiled_data".  
Save the scraped BUCS data into the "data" folder.  
Edit the R script to set the working directory to the "compiled_data" folder.  
You can now run the R script. This will take 2-3 minutes to run and will create 9 .csv files in the "compiled_data" folder. Once the script has run, it will delete all objects in the R environment.  

Running the indoor nationals compiler:  
Work in the same directory as the BUCS compiler.  
Save the scraped national indoors data into a folder named "indoor_nationals_data" (or copy paste the folder generated by the scraper).  
Edit the R script to set the working directory to the "compiled_data" folder.  
You can now run the R script. It should only take a few seconds to run and will create the "national_indoors.csv" file in the "compiled_data" folder.  
  
Running the plotting script:  
Create another subfolder named "results" in the same folder as the compiler script.  
In the plotting script, set the working directory to the same as for the compiler script.  
Run each plot script individually.  
Plots must be saved manually using the GUI.  
Significance levels are calculated using Wilcoxon tests.
